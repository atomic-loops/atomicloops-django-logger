# DRF API Logger


An API Logger for your Django Rest Framework project.

It logs all the API information for content type "application/json".
1. URL
2. Request Body
3. Request Headers
4. Request Method
5. API Response
6. Status Code
7. API Call Time
8. Server Execution Time
9. Client IP Address


You can log API information into the database or listen to the logger signals for different use-cases, or you can do both.

* The logger usage a separate thread to run, so it won't affect your API response time.

# This repository is a fork of the original drf-api-logger repository.
